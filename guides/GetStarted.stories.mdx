# Get Started
`React Native Design System` is a set of design rules and component library that lets you prototype faster with easy to use cross-platform components. Let's get started!

# Install
Simply go to the command line and run this command.
```sh
yarn add react-native-design-system
```
You can use `yarn` or `npm` as per your choice.
```sh
npm install react-native-design-system
```
This library needs `react-native-vector-icons` so go on and install that too to get all the cool icons. Check out [Install guide](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation).

# Usage
React Native Design System uses a centralized theme to provide consistency across all the components.

### Step 1. Import ThemeProvider and theme then wrap your root component.
This step is important. We are passing `theme` as context value that each component will access.

```js
//your root component
import { ThemeProvider, theme } from 'react-native-design-system';

function App(){
  return (
    <ThemeProvider value={theme}>
      <Root />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Step 2. Use component.

```js
//inside any file
import { Button } from 'react-native-design-system';

function HomeScreen(){
  return (
    <Button>
      Press Me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

That's pretty much it. `theme` file contains configuration for all the components. Don't worry, you can easily customize it. Let me show how:

# Customize
You just need to import `theme`, reassign the value you want to change and pass it to `ThemeProvider`. Example:  
Default primary color is blue but you like orange so you can simply do:

```js
import { ThemeProvider, theme } from 'react-native-design-system';

theme.brandColor.primary = "orange";

function App(){
  return (
    <ThemeProvider value={theme}>
      <Root />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

And we are done!
> You can see all the configurations available on the theme page.

# If you have a lot of customizations
This is just a personal approach, you can do as you prefer. What I usually do is create a `theme.config.js` file and add all my customizations there.

```js
//theme.config.js at root
import { theme } from 'react-native-design-system';

theme.textColor = {
    'default': '#000',
    'heading': '#999',
    'subtle': '#333',
    'grey': '#757575',
    'disabled': '#78909c',
    'white': '#f8f8f8',
};

export default theme;
```

Now, I will just import `theme` from here and pass it to my `ThemeProvider`.

```js
import { ThemeProvider } from 'react-native-design-system';
import theme from './theme.config.js';

function App(){
  return (
    <ThemeProvider value={theme}>
      <Root />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

> Please make sure to pass all the keys while reassigning any object inside the theme.

# Playground
Storybook provide interactive playground to test the component in all possible scenarios. There is a `playground` story at the end of each component. Click on that and switch to `Canvas` to access `Knobs` and `Actions` addons.

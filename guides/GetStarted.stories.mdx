# Get Started

`React Native Design System` is a set of design rules and component library that lets you prototype faster with easy to use cross-platform components. Let's get started!

# Install

Simply go to the command line and run this command.

```sh
yarn add react-native-design-system
```

You can use `yarn` or `npm` as per your choice.

```sh
npm install react-native-design-system
```

This library needs `react-native-vector-icons` so go on and install that too to get all the cool icons. Check out [Install guide](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation).

# Usage

React Native Design System uses a centralized theme to provide consistency across all the components.

### Step 1. Import ThemeProvider and theme then wrap your root component.

This step is important. We are passing `theme` as context value that each component will access. `ThemeProvider` also needs a `colorMode` prop to resolve the component UI to either light mode or dark mode.

```js
//your root component
import {ThemeProvider, theme} from 'react-native-design-system';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider value={theme} colorMode="light">
      <Root />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Step 2. Use component.

```js
//inside any file
import {Button} from 'react-native-design-system';

function HomeScreen() {
  return <Button>Press Me</Button>;
}
```

That's pretty much it. `theme` file contains configuration for all the components. Don't worry, you can easily customize it. Let me show how:

# Customize

You just need to import `theme`, reassign the value you want to change and pass it to `ThemeProvider`. Example:  
Default primary color is blue but you like orange so you can simply do:

```js
import {ThemeProvider, theme} from 'react-native-design-system';

theme.colors.primary = 'orange';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider value={theme} colorMode="light">
      <Root />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

And we are done!

> You can see all the configurations available on the theme page.

# If you have a lot of customizations

This is just a personal approach, you can do as you prefer. What I usually do is create a `theme.config.js` file and add all my customizations there.

```js
//theme.config.js at root
import {theme} from 'react-native-design-system';

theme.colors = {
  primary: '#000',
  heading: '#999',
  subtle: '#333',
  disabled: '#78909c',
};

export default theme;
```

Now, I will just import `theme` from here and pass it to my `ThemeProvider`.

```js
import {ThemeProvider} from 'react-native-design-system';
import theme from './theme.config.js';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider value={theme} colorMode="light">
      <Root />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

> Please make sure to pass all the keys while reassigning any object inside the theme.

### Using Dark Mode

You can access current mode via `useDarkMode` hook will give you `isDarkMode` and `toggleDarkMode`.

```js
//inside any file
import {Button, useDarkMode} from 'react-native-design-system';

function HomeScreen() {
  const { isDarkMode, toggleDarkMode } = useDarkMode();
  return (
    <Button color={isDarkMode ? 'red500' : 'blue500'} onPress={toggleDarkMode}>
      Press Me
    </Button>
  );
}

# Playground

Storybook provide interactive playground to test the component in all possible scenarios. There is a `playground` story at the end of each component. Click on that and switch to `Canvas` to access `Knobs` and `Actions` addons.
```
